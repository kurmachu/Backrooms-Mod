# Backrooms-Mod
The Backrooms Mod is an in-development experience that aims to create a semi-realistic backrooms-based enviroment in Minecraft.\
The project is a combination of Mod, Server and Program. This is the GitHub for the Mod, [the GitHub for the Program can be found here](https://github.com/kurmachu/BackroomBuilder). To check the progress of the project and to see planned features, please refer to [The Trello](https://trello.com/b/fGqeE8lz/backrooms-mod-i-guess).\
**Scroll down for server info** or **check directly below for a quick start guide**.
## I want...
### ...to download the mod.
First, you will need **Forge version `1.12.2-14.23.5.2768` or later**. Then, simply [download the latest release](https://github.com/kurmachu/Backrooms-Mod/releases/latest) or [view all releases](https://github.com/kurmachu/Backrooms-Mod/releases).\
Place the .jar in your mods folder. *If you would like to play on the server, you will need the [the latest release](https://github.com/kurmachu/Backrooms-Mod/releases/latest). If you would like to host a local world, you will need the `backroombuilder`, which is not currently available. in a compiled form. You may compile it from [here](https://github.com/kurmachu/BackroomBuilder).*
### ...to use the latest features.
If you want to use features which are not yet released, you will need to build the file yourself. A basic **understanding of IDEs and Java is recommended** but not required.\
To get started, first install [IntelliJ IDEA **Community**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or, if you already have a Java IDE you are free to use it. If you have gone with IntelliJ, proceed to follow the **installation steps**.\
After you have successfully installed the project, follow the steps under **Exporting to .jar**
### ...To contribute.
This project is super unprofessional, and anyone is free to contribute, if they know how. Please make sure you properly set up your enviroment before contributing. If you need help doing that, you probably shouldn't contribute yet. If you do know how and are planning on contributing, check out [The Trello](https://trello.com/b/fGqeE8lz/backrooms-mod-i-guess) for things we need to do, and contact me before beginning any work. *If you forget or intentionally neglect to contact me beforehand, I will **not** instantly deny any PR, I just would like to know what is happening.*
## Installation
Clone the repository, then simply open the project in Intellij and run the Forge setup tasks:\
`setupDecompWorkspace`\
`setupDevWorkspace`\
`genIntellijRuns`\
You can then launch the game by running `Minecraft Client` from the run menu.\
*If you open this in eclipse you are on your own.*
## Exporting to .jar
Make sure you have a working enviroment, then in your favorite IDE run the `build` task. It's as simple as that. Your new jars will be available under `./build/libs/`. If you would like to run it in Forge, use the one without `-sources`.
# The Server
The server is usually available 24/7 and is hosted on `104.236.55.132`. The only mod on the server is The Backrooms. *Please note that the server is as much in development as this mod is.*
# Contact
If you would like to contact me or request more info, `104.236.55.132` has its own [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wJBAn8B). It is the recommeded way to stay up to date on updates, chat with others interested in the project or request features.
